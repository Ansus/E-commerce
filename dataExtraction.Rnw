% First we extract data from a csv file.

dat = read.csv("data.csv", header = TRUE)

The dataset contains a list of invoices probably related to items sold by a company between the 1st December 2010 and the 9th December 2011.
Each invoice is uniquely identified by a \textit{InvoiceNo} and may contain different items, described by its \textit{StockCode} and Descripion, which are sold in different quantities and unit prices. Each client is identified by a code, the \textit{CustumerID}, and the country where the item was sold is displayed in the column \textit{Country}. Notice that in some cases one single client can place orders from different countries (e.g. client 12370 from Austria and Cyprus).


<<preliminary-1>>=
df= df_status(dat, print_results = F) %>% 
  select(.,-c(6,7,8)) %>% as.data.frame()

Preliminary analysis show that the dataset contains \Sexpr{ncol(dat)} variables and \Sexpr{nrow(dat)} observations. A quick look to the dataset reveals that there are 2515 item sold for 0â‚¬, while almost the $25\%$ of the customers IDs are missing.

  kable(format= "latex" , booktabs=T,  align = "c", escape=F, linesep = "") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c( "hold_position")) %>% 
  gsub("_", "-", .)
